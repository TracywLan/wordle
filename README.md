## Game Information

**Name:** Wordle  
  
**Description:**  
A recreation of the popular *New York Times* game **Wordle**. Players are given 6 guesses to find the secret 5-letter word.

**Background:**  
I chose to make Wordle because I've been a big fan of the game. My friends and I have been playing it together for the past half-year and always compete to see who can solve the puzzle in the fewest guesses. I thought it would be fun to recreate the game using my newly learned coding skills.
