## Pseudocode
1. Game display module will have 5 x 6 square blocks
2. On the bottom of the module, an input box that the player can type their guessed word, and a enter button
3. Player will enter 5 letter word into the input box and click enter
4. The word entered must be a valid word that is also in the word list, else, will display error
5. Once a valid word is entered and player clicks enter, the word will be displayed in the square blacks on the module
6. If the letter of the word they got is correct and is in the right position, it will turn green, if the letter is correct but in the wrong position it will turn yellow. If the word does not contain the input letter, it will stay grey.
7. When player make a second guess, the new word will display on the second line.
8. If the player guess the word right in 6 turns they win. if they cannot guess the word, they lose.
